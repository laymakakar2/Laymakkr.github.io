    <h1>Existing IT Ethics for Developers</h1>
    <p>Data is a very powerful asset and with great power comes great responsibility. Developers create and use large datasets in order for their creations to function. The very popular <a href="https://neveragain.tech/" target="_blank">neveragain.tech</a> pledge is where developers and other tech employees have pledged to not engage in racial, ethnic, and other types of discrimination through the creation and use of data.</p>
    <h2>Data Privacy</h2>
    <p>Compliance with data privacy regulations is of utmost importance. Companies face large fiscal repercussions if these regulations are breached. This may arise as a result of losing users, being the victims of cyberattacks, or even as simple as fines from governing organizations. (Abbas, p. 1) <a href="https://codingcrafts.medium.com/data-privacy-in-software-development-c83de41db5c9" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
    <h2>Bias</h2>
    <p>Biases should not be implemented into algorithms, to the best ability possible. 
        "Some algorithms run the risk of replicating and even amplifying human biases" (para. 5, Lee). 
        Bias should not be baked into an algorithm's code.

    <h2>Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>Data collection, storage, usage, and retention should be transparent to all parties involved. (Abbas, p. 1) <a href="https://codingcrafts.medium.com/data-privacy-in-software-development-c83de41db5c9" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
